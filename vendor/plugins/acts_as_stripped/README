ActsAsStripped
==============

Strips HTML out of an attribute whenever it's displayed - even if it's in a form input box/textarea. 
NOTE: no stripping happens when the attribute is written, only read.
NOTE: value is converted to string; so for example if you errantly list an integer attribute in the attribute list 
it's going to come back as a string.

Inspired by Err's acts_as_textiled, but I needed some attributes to be displayed without textile messing with 
underscores and astrisks. 

And I don't trust myself to sanitize HTML in views 100% of the time. 

Use like so: 

class SomeModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_stripped :name, :description
	
	# ...
end

If you need to get the unstripped value, you can always use: your_model.attributes["att_name"]

Install with:
script/plugin install git://github.com/jlapier/acts_as_stripped.git
